download installer for your platform I used this link:

https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

make the file executable with

sudo chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

try it out. simply run "conda" you should see some interesting output that lists available commands.
